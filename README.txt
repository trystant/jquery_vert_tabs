JQuery Vert Tabs
=================

This is a copy of the jquery-vert-tabs plugin, a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin for impementing vertical tab navigation on a web site. This is based on the [jquery-vert-tabs](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-vert-tabs/) plugin by Seth Lenzi, with some additional logging for debugging purposes as well as a change that sets the method for making AJAX requests to POST.
